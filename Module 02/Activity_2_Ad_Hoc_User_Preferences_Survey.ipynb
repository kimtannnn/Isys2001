        "\n",
        "## Learning Outcome\n",
        "\n",
        "Explore how to gather and display user preferences through an open-ended programming task. This activity encourages experimentation and resourcefulness with the concepts of input and output in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Note:** In this activity, I encourage you to experiment freely with your ideas. In the next activity, we follow a more structured approach, so feel free to explore different methods here and see how a systematic workflow can be applied later.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Tip:** Remember, using clear and descriptive variable names can make your code easier to understand as your programmes grow.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Instructions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Write a Python Script:**  \n",
        "   Develop a programme that asks the user about their preferences and then presents those preferences back to them.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Hint:** Think of your script as a conversation between you and the computer. Ask questions and respond with a summary!\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Gather Preferences:**  \n",
        "   - Choose at least three different preferences to ask the user about (for example, favourite colour, favourite food, favourite hobby, favourite movie, etc.).\n",
        "   - Use the `input()` function to capture the user’s responses.\n",
        "   \n",
        "> **AI Tip:** If you’re unsure of what to ask, try brainstorming a list of interests and see which ones spark your curiosity.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Present Preferences:**  \n",
        "   - Use the `print()` function to display the gathered preferences in a clear and organised manner.\n",
        "   - Consider constructing a summary message that incorporates the user’s inputs, for example:  \n",
        "     \n",
        "     > \"Hello, [name]! Your favourite colour is [colour], you love [food], and you enjoy [hobby].\"\n",
        "     \n",
        "> **Advanced Concept:** The `print()` function can take multiple arguments separated by commas, automatically adding a space between them. This is a simple way to format your output without needing to manually insert spaces.\n",
